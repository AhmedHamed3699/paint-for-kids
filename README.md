## Conventions and Team guide lines.
### Naming:
* Minimize the use of abbreviations
* Do not abbreviate by deleting letters within a word. As a rule of thumb, an abbreviation is probably OK if it's listed in Wikipedia.
```cpp
int nmbr = 5; ❌
int number = 5; ✅
```
* Vaiables should be written in "camelCase"
```cpp
int Important-VaRiable = 5; ❌
int importantVariable = 5; ✅
```
* Class names and types should be written in "PascalCase"
```cpp
class Distance
{
  ...
};
```
* Constants should be written in UPPERCASE
```cpp
const double PI = 3.1468; 
```
* Filenames should be all lowercase and can include dashes (-)
```
main-file-in-project.cpp
```
* Functions should start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word
```cpp
void DrawRectangle()
{
  ...
}
```
* accessors and mutators may be named like variables Using CamalCase (getters and setters)
```cpp
void Input:getColor()
{
  ...
}
```
